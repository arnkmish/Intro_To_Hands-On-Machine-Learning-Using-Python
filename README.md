# Introduction To Hands-On Machine Learning Using Python
This repository contains the iPython notebook files corresponding to my practical sessions at the "7-days Hands On Machine Learning Using Python" workshop(TEQIP-Funded) at GUIST, Guwahati University, held on 16-22 Aug. 2020.

As part of this workshop, I served as the sole resource person for the hands-on sessions, which covered the following topics-

1. Topic 0.1: Python Basics
2. Topic 0.2: Numpy Basics
3. Topic 0.3: Pandas Basics
4. Topic 1: Exploratory data analysis for diabetes prediction.
5. Topic 2: Exploratory data analysis for breast cancer prediction.
6. Topic 4: Clustering using K-Means.
7. Topic 5: Traditional Machine Learning based classification of medical imaging data.
8. Topic 6: Traditional Machine Learning based text classification.
9. Topic 7: Deep Neural Networks based breast cancer prediction.
10. Topic 8: Convolutional Neural Network based handwritten digit recognition.
11. Topic 9: Convolutional Neural Network based classification of medical image data.
12. Topic 10: Text Sentiment analysis using LSTM based RNN.

Corresponding to each of the topic mentioned above, iPython notebooks have been uploaded in this repository.

Datasets utilized in this workshop are-

1. PIMA Indian diabetes dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
2. Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))
